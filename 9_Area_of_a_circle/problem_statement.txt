Write a program to find Area of a circle

formula:
Area = pi * r * r 
    where
        pi = 3.14159


Sample Input/Output

r = 7 -> 153.94
r = 0 -> 0.00
r = 1 -> 3.14
r = 5.5 -> 95.03

Note:
    For the sample inputs and outputs, the area values have been rounded to two decimal places for presentation. Depending on the precision of 
Ï€ used in calculations and rounding methods, the output might slightly vary.
